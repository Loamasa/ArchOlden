# PÃ¥l Schakonat 

I am a game developer who is looking to transition in to the regular IT-Industry. As a technically-oriented game designer, I have experience in both the UX apsects and technical implementation of an product.

## About Me

I shipped two games at the VR game studio, Fast Travel Games. **I also developed my own game where I handled everything from C++, Visual Scripting, production, pitching, and much more.** I received great feedback, but the current recession caused our investors at Xsolla to back off. Instead of updating my portfolio to get a job in the game industry, I made the decision to transition to the regular IT industry.</p>

**I got my exam at The Game Assembly, which is ranked as one of the top schools in the world.** We learned Agile, multidisciplinary teamwork, and built 8 projects during 2 years. I have completed a leadership course for digital management (as preparation for running my own company) and participated in the Start-Program at Ideon Science Park BUILD. **I have experience with both C# and C++, as well as visual scripting in game engines**. I've developed numerous products with agile, cross-disciplinary teams from start to finish, both in the industry and in my own studio.</p>

## Portfolio Pice One: ARCHOLDEN - A game developed by my studio Golden Possum

### Discripton

ArchOlden is a puzzle builder with rogue-like mechanics, offering an easy and relaxing experience. **Start with a procedurally generated mountain and draw buildings to be placed on the summit. Plan your city to earn the maximum points from your buildings.** As you play, you'll unlock new buildings and you expand your summit. Completing a challenge ascend you to an even harder challenge, but you will be rewarded with divine gifts. Test your puzzle-solving skills as the gods judge your worthiness to ascend.

### My participation

**I am the founder of Golden Possum, focusing on all technical**, but also production, Game Design and Business development. I pitch, attend conferences, budget, planning, recruitment, and long-term development. We develop in Unreal engine. We were a team of three; the others helped with game art and sound.
